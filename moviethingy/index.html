                <p>We're currently studying frontend development and gor an assignment to use the omdb-api to make a webpage that works similarly to IMDB.
                    the page was supposed to have the function of searching and also saving things in a json-bin of our own. 
                    It was tricky and we had to really work together to make this work. This is not yet refined and there is still work to do to make it 
                    look as refined as we'd like. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    This home page is definitely one of the main things that still needs a lot of work and I'm now just typing just to get something
                    on this page at all. The footer that exists in the code is not yet really visible on the page yet as it hasn't gotten 
                    any work at all. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I just figured it would look slightly better if there was something at all on the homepage so I'm now just typing away... ðŸ˜†ðŸ˜†ðŸ˜†
